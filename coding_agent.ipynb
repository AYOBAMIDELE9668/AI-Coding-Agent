            "Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.\n",

            "**Analogy:**\n",
            "Imagine a glass of water with air bubbles. The larger, lighter bubbles \"bubble up\" to the top. Similarly, in bubble sort, larger elements \"bubble up\" to their correct position at the end of the list with each pass.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Steps for a single pass:**\n",
            "1.  Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
            "2.  Compare the first two elements.\n",
            "3.  If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
            "4.  Move to the next pair of elements (second and third) and repeat the comparison and swap.\n",
            "5.  Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.\n",
            "6.  After one full pass, the largest unsorted element will be in its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the array.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Repeat:**\n",
            "You repeat these passes. In each subsequent pass, you only need to go up to the *n-i-1* element, where `n` is the total number of elements and `i` is the number of completed passes (because the last `i` elements are already sorted).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Termination:**\n",
            "The algorithm can stop early if a full pass completes without any swaps. This indicates that the list is already sorted.\n",

            "*   **Time Complexity:**\n",
            "    *   **Worst Case:** O(n^2) - when the array is sorted in reverse order.\n",

            "2.  **`n = len(arr)`**: Gets the number of elements in the list.\n",
            "3.  **Outer loop `for i in range(n)`**: This loop controls the number of passes. In each pass `i`, the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end of the unsorted part. After `i` passes, the last `i` elements are guaranteed to be sorted.\n",
            "4.  **`swapped = False`**: A flag to detect if any swaps occurred in the current pass.\n",
            "5.  **Inner loop `for j in range(0, n - i - 1)`**: This loop iterates through the unsorted portion of the list.\n",
            "    *   `n - i - 1`: The `-i` part ensures we don't compare elements that are already sorted at the end of the list. The `-1` is because we're comparing `arr[j]` with `arr[j+1]`, so `j` goes up to the second-to-last element.\n",

            "2.  **Reducing Comparison Range:** In each pass `i`, the largest `i` elements are already in their correct sorted positions at the end of the list. So, the inner loop only needs to go up to `n - i - 1` elements, reducing unnecessary comparisons.\n",

            "    *   **Selection Sort:** While also O(n^2), Selection Sort performs fewer swaps (O(n) swaps in total) than Bubble Sort (O(n^2) swaps in worst case), which can be advantageous if writes (swaps) are significantly more expensive than reads (comparisons).\n",

            "    *   **Python's Built-in `sort()` and `sorted()`:** Python uses **Timsort**, which is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
